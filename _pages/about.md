## Background

Welcome to my page! I am a bioinformatics scientist in the Cardiovascular Research Center at NYU Langone Health.

I received a PhD in cancer bioinformatics at Albert Einstein College of Medicine. My PhD focused on studying the role of E3 ligase targetting component SKP2 in the immune microenvironment and metastasis of osteosarcoma using single-cell transcriptomics. Before that, I received a Masters in biotechnology from Columbia University with thesis research completed at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, as well as a Bachelors in biology from New York University.


## Skills and Interests

I am a computational biologist interested in the intersection of technology and science, especially with regard to health. I am highly proficient in R and transcriptomic data analysis. I am also interested and skilled in general data analysis and machine learning, especially in the realm of clinical data.

I have long been interested in translational research, biotechnology, and pharmaceuticals. I received a competitve fellowship called the PhD in Clinical Investigation at Einstein which supports clinical and translational research, offers formal biostatistics training, and funded most of my PhD. I founded and led an omics-oriented educational and networking society, the Einstein Montefiore Omics Club. Additionally, I served as vice-president of the Einstein Biotech Club.

I am a nature lover and an animal lover, and share my home with a little cat named Primrose and two aquariums.
