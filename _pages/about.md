## Background

I am a Senior Bioinformatics Programmer in the Cardiovascular Research Center at NYU Langone Health.

I received a PhD in cancer bioinformatics at Albert Einstein College of Medicine. My PhD focused on studying the role of E3 ligase targetting component SKP2 in the immune microenvironment and metastasis of osteosarcoma using single-cell transcriptomics, under the mentorship of bioinformatics expert Deyou Zheng and orthopedics professor Bang Hoang.


## Skills and Interests

I am a computational biologist interested in the intersection of technology and science, especially with regard to health. I am highly proficient in R and transcriptomic data analysis. I am also interested and skilled in general data analysis and machine learning, especially in the realm of clinical data.

I am very interested in translational medicine, biotechnology, and pharmaceutical industry. I founded and led an omics-oriented educational society, the Einstein Montefiore Omics Club. Additionally, I served as vice-president of the Einstein Biotech Club.
